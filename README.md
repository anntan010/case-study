# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

Forter

* When was the company incorporated?

2013

* Who are the founders of the company?

Alon Shemesh, Liron Damri, Michael Reitblat

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The company was founded in 2014 by software engineers who formerly worked at Fraud Sciences, which was bought and integrated into PayPal in 2008. Before working at Fraud Sciences, the founders served in the Israeli Army's Intelligence unit.

The founders experienced repeated credit card issues and said that there had to be a better way. The founders were childhood friends and as Israelis working in the US, they had complex online identities. Like many others, they would shop online, reserve flights, and buy goods only to have those transactions declined. They began their careers together at a manual fraud review company that PayPal later acquired. Once employed by PayPal, Liron saw first hand that staffing thousands of people to review transactions would never scale in a global economy.

After successfully leading an experiment to lift the manual, rules-based processes and replace them with an AI-powered model, PayPal’s fraud detection accuracy skyrocketed. When Liron overheard customers asking if they could buy their new fraud solution as a standalone product, he knew they were on to something. Liron and Michael reunited to build Forter, a fully automated platform that makes decisions about every eCommerce interaction based on a complete understanding of identity. Their focus from day one has been on using customer intelligence to give everyone the eCommerce experiences they deserve.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

The company is funded by institutional investors in a series of funding rounds. The latest round is Series F. The company has received $525 million to date.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Forter’s Decision-as-a-Service technology is a personalized and automated decision maker for the retail and financial industries. The automated 'Decisioning' system tracks trends and flags fraudulent spending in less than one second. Payments are processed by Forter's technology and marked as approved or flagged for fraud in order to give businesses a more holistic view of their revenues.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Customers are primarily ecommerce businesses. The global ecommerce market is expected to total $5.55 trillion in 2022. That figure is estimated to grow over the next few years.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Forter claims that it has more depth of data than any other competitor and this will help it triumph. Its database covers more than one billion customers globally.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Forter's technology is fraud analytics. This includes behavioral analysis of customers' established shopping patterns, soft linking (the ability to trace relationships between users even when no overt information is shared) and other techniques. Forter offers clients the option of full restitution in the event of a chargeback.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Incorporate privacy aware data analytics tools into their fraud prevention products.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

The tools would allow Forter to ensure that privacy regulations such as GDPR are complied with.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Technologies would include machine learning algorithms and additional data sets.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Because machine learning data analysis allows for added accuracy which can be used in multiple use cases e.g. central agile workflows across privacy, security, data governance, GRC, third-party risk, ethics and compliance, and ESG programs.
